# output

This is where the infographic PDF will be exported.
Unlike in a traditional `meltano` project, this is where _only_ analysis outputs will live, not
extract or load outputs. As such, this is essentially coupled with the [analyze](../analyze/)
directory. Consult the `analyze` [README](../analyze/README.md) for instructions on output generation
(e.g. infographic generation).
